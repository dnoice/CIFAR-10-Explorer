## Machine Learning Models

CIFAR-10 Nexus supports training and evaluation of several neural network architectures:

| Architecture | Parameters | Training Time | Typical Accuracy | Best For |
|--------------|------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| CNN          | ~1.2M      | 5-10 minutes  | 82%              | Quick experiments, learning |
| ResNet-18    | ~11M       | 15-20 minutes | 89%              | High accuracy, research |
| MobileNetV2  | ~2.3M      | 8-12 minutes  | 87%              | Balanced performance, deployment |
| EfficientNet | ~5.3M      | 12-18 minutes | 91%              | State-of-the-art results |
